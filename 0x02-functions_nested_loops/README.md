	->> NOTE:
- In this project we are not allowed to use [global variables] or to use the standard library fuctions like [printf, puts, etc..] but we are going use the putchar funtion.
	

	->> NEW ISSUES:
- what is imporstat and that i've learnd now is that there is other ways or other theams in writting c programs.
- For example the second task was to write a program that prints lowercase alphabets and doing this program without the use of the standard lib functions as I mentioned above.
- the strange thing about this is that we changed every singel thing:

			1. we changed the [<stdio.h> lib --> "main.h" hederfile]
			2. we changed the declaration [from int main(void --> the prototype of the function used)] 
			3. becouse we change the main function we also changed the discription to function in use.
			4. we are not writing the return 0; in the end but we are just keep it with the description.
			5. and we are using the functions outside the stdard lib.
